# Load Balancing: The Game

This is a game that I created in 2015, while I was working for a start-up company that operated in the field of DNS and networking, for the purpose of explaining the challenges of DNS load balancing. I further improved it in the same year, during a project for my Master's degree.

I uploaded the initial [design document](./docs/design-document.md) and the [final report](./docs/report.md) produced as part of the project, in case anyone is interested in the original design process that gave life to the game.

It was written in JavaScript and its architecture was at the level you would expect from a student at his first experience writing an HTML canvas game.

I decided to revisit it ten years later, porting it to TypeScript and performing some much needed refactoring.
Mostly this is an exercise to see what changed in my skills during these ten years working in the field of web development.
