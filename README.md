# Load Balancing: The Game

This is a project I created in 2015, during my Master's degree.

It was written in JavaScript and its architecture was at the level you would expect from a student at its first experience writing an HTML canvas game.

I decided to revisit it ten years later, porting it to TypeScript and performing some much needed refactoring.
Mostly this is an exercise to see what changed in my skills during these ten years working in the field of web development.
